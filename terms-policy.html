        <p><b>Termination/Access Restriction</b></p>
        <p>
          pgecom reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
          terminate your access to the Site and the related services or any
          portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent
          permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State
          of California and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and
          venue of courts in California in all disputes arising out of or
          relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in
          any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these
          Terms, including, without limitation, this section.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
          relationship exists between you and pgecom as a result of
          this agreement or use of the Site. pgecom’s performance of
          this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and
          nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of
          pgecom’s right to comply with governmental, court and law
          enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site
          or information provided to or gathered by pgecom with
          respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be
          invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not
          limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set
          forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be
          deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
          matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the
          agreement shall continue in effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the
          entire agreement between the user and pgecom with respect to
          the Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications
          and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user
          and pgecom with respect to the Site. A printed version of
          this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be
          admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
          relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same
          conditions as other business documents and records originally
          generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to
          the parties that this agreement and all related documents be written
          in English.

        <p><b>Changes to Terms</b></p>
